Congenital heart defects may produce symptoms at birth, during childhood, and sometimes not until adulthood.In most cases scientists don't know why they occur. Heredity may play a role, as well as exposure to the fetus during pregnancy to certain viral infections, alcohol, or drugs. CardiomyopathiesCardiomyopathies are diseases of the heart muscle itself. People with cardiomyopathies -- sometimes called an enlarged heart -- have hearts that are abnormally enlarged, thickened, and/or stiffened. As a result, the heart's ability to pump blood is weakened. Without treatment, cardiomyopathies worsen over time and often lead to heart failure and abnormal heart rhythms. PericarditisPericarditis is inflammation of the lining that surrounds the heart. It is a rare condition that is often caused by an infection. Aorta Disease and Marfan SyndromeThe aorta is the large artery that leaves the heart and provides oxygen-rich blood throughout the body. These diseases and conditions can cause the aorta to dilate (widen) or dissect (tear), increasing the risk for future life-threatening events, such as:Atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries)High blood pressureGenetic conditions such as Marfan SyndromeConnective tissue disorders (that affect the strength of the blood vessel walls) such as, scleroderma, osteogenesis imperfecta, polycystic kidney disease, and Turner's syndromeInjuryPeople with aorta disease should be treated by an experienced team of cardiovascular specialists and surgeons.

									In this articleWhat is Metabolic Syndrome?How Is Metabolic Syndrome Diagnosed?How Common Is Metabolic Syndrome?What Causes Metabolic Syndrome?What Are the Dangers in Having Metabolic Syndrome?How Is Metabolic Syndrome Treated?Changing Eating HabitsAdopting an Exercise PlanCosmetic Surgery to Remove FatWhat if Lifestyle Changes Are Not Enough to Treat Metabolic Syndrome? Changing Eating HabitsDiets come and go, but more recently, experts recommend the Mediterranean diet -- one that is rich in "good" fats (olive oil) and contains a reasonable amount of carbohydrates and proteins (such as from fish and chicken).The Mediterranean diet is palatable and easy to maintain. In addition, recent studies have shown that when compared to a low-fat diet, people on the Mediterranean diet have a greater decrease in body weight and greater improvements in blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other markers of heart disease, all of which are important in evaluating and treating metabolic syndrome. Adopting an Exercise PlanA sustainable exercise program -- for example, 30 minutes a day 5 days a week -- is reasonable as a starting point, providing there is no medical reason you can't. If you have any special concerns in this regard, check with your doctor first. Exercise has a beneficial effect on blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and insulin sensitivity, regardless of whether you lose weight. In itself, exercise is helpful in treating metabolic syndrome. Cosmetic Surgery to Remove FatSo, if a large waistline is the problem, why not just have liposuction to remove the fat? It's not so simple. Studies show no benefit in liposuction on insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, or cholesterol. As the saying goes, "If it's too good to be true, it probably is." Diet and exercise are still the preferred first-line treatment of metabolic syndrome. What if Lifestyle Changes Are Not Enough to Treat Metabolic Syndrome?What if changes in diet and activity levels do not do the trick? Drugs to control cholesterol and high blood pressure may be considered.Blood pressure goals are generally set lower than 140/90, and recommendations may change depending on your age. Some blood pressure medications -- ACE inhibitors -- have also been found to reduce levels of insulin resistance and to defer the complications of type 2 diabetes. This is an important consideration when discussing the choice of blood pressure drugs in the metabolic syndrome.Metformin (Glucophage), usually used to treat type 2 diabetes, also has been found to help prevent the onset of diabetes in people with metabolic syndrome. However, there are currently no established guidelines on treating metabolic syndrome patients with metformin if they do not have a diabetes diagnosis.WebMD Medical ReferenceView Article Sources SOURCE: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

									In this articleTypes of Heart StentsInnovations in Heart StentsFont SizeAAAStents are small expandable tubes used to treat narrowed or weakened arteries in the body. In patients with coronary heart disease, caused by the buildup of plaque, stents are used to open narrowed arteries and help reduce symptoms such as chest pain (angina) or to help treat a heart attack.These types of stents are commonly called heart stents, but they're also referred to as cardiac stents or coronary stents. Usually made of metal mesh, heart stents are implanted in narrowed coronary arteries during a procedure called a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or angioplasty.

But while there, the angina went from mild to severe. The pain would come and go, but on three separate occasions the pain was the most massive...Read the WebMD the Magazine's My Story: Cardiac Recovery article > >  Cardioversion can be used to treat many types of fast and/or irregular heart rhythms. Most often, it is used to treat atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. But cardioversion may also be used to treat ventricular tachycardia, another arrhythmia that can lead to a dangerous condition called ventricular fibrillation (a cause of sudden cardiac death.) How Is Cardioversion Performed?During cardioversion, your heart and blood pressure are monitored and a short-acting sedative is given. Then an electrical shock is delivered to your chest wall through paddles or patches that stops the abnormal heartbeat and allows your heart to resume a normal rhythm.Your doctor may want to give you blood thinners prior to and for a period after the procedure.In some people, a moderately invasive imaging test called transesophageal echocardiogram (or TEE) may be performed prior to the cardioversion to make sure that the heart is free from blood clots. The TEE is performed by swallowing a narrow tube with a camera at its tip that can be placed against the back wall of the heart.Because the patient is sedated, the shock isn't felt or remembered. A successful cardioversion may take several electrical shocks. What's the Difference Between Cardioversion and Defibrillation?Cardioversion and defibrillation procedures both use a device to deliver an electrical shock to the heart.Electrical cardioversion, however, uses much lower electricity levels to give the shock than defibrillation. Defibrillation is often used to treat much more difficult-to- convert arrhythmias. What Happens After Cardioversion?Recovery from cardioversion only takes a few hours.After the procedure, you may also be required to take antiarrhythmia drugs to help your heart maintain its normal rhythm.Additional cardioversion procedures may be needed.WebMD Medical ReferenceView Article Sources SOURCES:Heart Rhythm Society: "Cardioversion."National Heart Lung and Blood Institute: "What Is Cardioversion."

									In this articleHow Does EECP Work?What Happens During EECP Treatment?How Often Are EECP Treatments?Who Is a Candidate for EECP?Font SizeAAAWhen all other treatments have failed to relieve persistent angina (chest pain) symptoms, enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) may be an option. EECP can help stimulate blood vessels to develop small branches, creating a natural bypass around narrowed or blocked arteries that cause the chest pain. How Does EECP Work?The EECP treatment uses a series of blood pressure cuffs on both legs to gently but firmly compress the blood vessels in the lower limbs to increase blood flow to the heart. Each wave of pressure is electronically timed to the heartbeat, so that the increased blood flow is delivered to your heart at the precise moment it is relaxing.When the heart pumps again, pressure is released instantaneously. This lowers resistance in the blood vessels in the legs so that blood may be pumped more easily from your heart.EECP may encourage some small blood vessels in the heart to open. These collateral blood vessels may eventually become "natural bypass" vessels to provide blood flow to heart muscle. This contributes to the relief of chest pain. What Happens During EECP Treatment?EECP is a non-invasive, outpatient therapy. During treatment:Patients lie down on a padded table in a treatment room.Three electrodes are applied to the skin of the chest and connected to an electrocardiograph (ECG). The ECG will display the heart's rhythm during treatment. Blood pressure is also monitored.A set of cuffs is wrapped around the calves, thighs, and buttocks. These cuffs attach to air hoses that connect to valves that inflate and deflate the cuffs. Patients experience a sensation of a strong "hug" moving upward from calves to thighs to buttocks during inflation followed by the rapid release of pressure on deflation. Inflation and deflation are electronically synchronized with the heartbeat and blood pressure. How Often Are EECP Treatments?Patients who are accepted for EECP treatment must undergo 35 hours of therapy. Treatment is administered 1-2 hours a day, five days a week, for 7 weeks. Who Is a Candidate for EECP?You may be a candidate for EECP if you:Have chronic stable anginaAre not receiving adequate relief by taking nitrates, calcium channel blockers, and beta-blockersDo not qualify as a candidate for invasive procedures (bypass surgery, angioplasty, or stenting)Published studies conducted at numerous medical centers have demonstrated benefits for most patients undergoing EECP, including:Less need for anti-anginal medicationDecrease in symptoms of anginaIncreased ability to do activities without onset of symptomsAbility to return to enjoyable activitiesWebMD Medical ReferenceView Article Sources SOURCES:HeartHealthyWomen.org: "EECP: What is enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP)?"Cleveland Clinic: "Enhanced external counterpulsation."

An ICD is an electronic device that constantly monitors your heart rate and rhythm. When it detects a very fast, abnormal heart rhythm, it delivers energy to the heart muscle. This causes the heart to beat in a normal rhythm again.The ICD has two parts: the lead(s) and a pulse generator. The lead(s) are made up of wires and sensors that monitor the heart rhythm and deliver energy used for pacing and/or defibrillation (see below for definitions). The generator houses the battery and a tiny computer. Energy is stored in the battery until it is needed. The computer receives information from the leads to determine how the heart is beating.

Diuretics, commonly known as "water pills," help your body get rid of unneeded water and salt through the urine. Getting rid of excess fluid makes it easier for your heart to pump and controls blood pressure. Examples of diuretics include:Lasix (furosemide)Bumex (bumetanide)Demadex (torsemide)Esidrix (hydrochlorothiazide)Zaroxolyn (metolazone)Aldactone (spironolactone)Diuretics are categorized as thiazide-like (Zaroxolyn and Esidrix), loop (Lasix, Bumex, Demadex) or potassium sparing (Aldactone). Thiazide diuretics cause moderate increases in water excretion and are appropriate for long-term use. Loop diuretics are more powerful and are especially useful in emergencies. Potassium-sparing diuretics help your body retain the mineral potassium and are often prescribed in conjunction with the other two types of diuretics.
